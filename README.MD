#### Scrimba

Most of the content of this folder is based on Scrimba's excellent free React JS online course which can be found here:

My code differs from the one provided by the tuitor (Bob Ziroll), because I found it more valuable to try to implement the functionalities more independently while of course following closely their approach and solutions.
It goes without saying that the latter is far better than my own creations.
